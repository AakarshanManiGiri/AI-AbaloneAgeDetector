This specific repository contains a linear regression model that is task-fitted to predict the age of abalone based on the input of physical dimensions as the data specifically the length diameter and shell weight. 
The dataset used as test and train is the UCI Abalone Dataset its designed to be efficient, reduce required man-power, where age to harvest is typically checked manually which can be time and money intensive and relies heavily on skilled labor.
